## Full Description

> Note Taker is a fast, private note-taking app that pushes your notes directly to a GitHub repository. Open the app, speak or type your thought, and it's saved as a markdown file in your repo within seconds.
>
> **How it works:**
> Your notes are pushed to a GitHub repository you control using the GitHub Contents API. Each note becomes a markdown file in your repo's inbox/ folder. A personal access token (PAT) authenticates the connection — no OAuth, no third-party servers, no accounts to create.
>
> **Voice-first input:**
> Tap the app and start speaking. Note Taker uses Android's built-in speech recognition to transcribe your words. No audio is recorded or stored by Note Taker. Switch to keyboard mode anytime by tapping the text field.
>
> **Offline queuing:**
> No internet? Notes are saved locally and automatically uploaded when connectivity returns. You'll never lose a thought.
>
> **Browse your notes:**
> View your entire repository from within the app. Navigate folders, read markdown files with full rendering, and review your note history.
>
> **Privacy by design:**
> - Notes go directly to YOUR GitHub repo via HTTPS
> - Speech recognition handled by your device's built-in speech service
> - No analytics, no ads, no tracking
> - No third-party services beyond the GitHub API
> - Your GitHub PAT is stored locally in app-private storage
>
> **Features:**
> • Voice and keyboard note input
> • One-tap submission to GitHub
> • Offline note queuing with automatic retry
> • Repository browser with markdown rendering
> • Current topic display from your repo
> • Lock screen quick capture (via digital assistant)
> • Dark theme
>
> **Requirements:**
> • A GitHub account with a repository for your notes
> • A fine-grained personal access token (PAT) with Contents read/write permission
>
> Note Taker is open source. View the code on GitHub.
